## Permission System
The permission system allows you to control which admins can perform which actions.
For instance you can allow one admin to only view the console and kick players, but not restart the server and execute arbitrary commands.
The permissions are saved in the `txData/admins.json` file and can be edited through the *Admin Manager* page by the Master admin, or users with `all_permissions` or `manage.admins` permissions.
