Legend:
- [ ] -> Not started
- [x] -> Completed
- [!] -> Release Blocker
- [?] -> Lower priority or pending investigation

## Previous bugs
- [x] player/history modal is cutting bottom of title (test with "jgpq", etc)
- [x] `lipsum` suffix to all the crash reasons
- [x] thread chart data is the cumulative sum and not the diff, so it "averages out"
- [x] use the fxRunner PID to get the correct fxserver process - perfUtils.fetchFxsMemory
- [x] fix the uptime detection
- [?] investigate player desync issues
- [?] ctrl+f doesn't work in the player modal anymore, if on the player or history pages
    - criar um estado "any modal open" pra desabilitar todos hotkeys das p√°ginas?

## Highlights
- [x] Anonymous admin actions (issue #893)
    - [x] add settings
    - [x] add convars to fxrunner
    - [x] add public AdminVault.getAdminPublicName(name: string, purpose: enum)
    - [x] to hide:
    - [x] hide from: ban reject connection
        - doesn't have the admin object, just name
    - [x] hide from: ban kick
        - has event, but only requires changing tOptions for the reason
    - [x] hide from: warn
        - edit txaEventHandlers.playerWarned
    - [x] hide from: dm
        - edit txaEventHandlers.playerDirectMessage
    - [x] hide from: announcement
        - edit txaEventHandlers.announcement
        - [edit](/core/webroutes/fxserver/commands.ts#L91)
        - [edit](/core/components/FxRunner/outputHandler.ts#L148)

    - [x] improved in game player search
    - related: https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/pull/968
- [x] Offline warning
    - show when rejoin and IS_PED_WALKING, requires showing when it happened to the player (Issue #522)
    - Thought: offline warns need a prop to mark if they have been checked, instead of bool, could be an int for "viewed" and also count up for every join blocked on banned players

    - [x] charts: get "changes" back to chart?
    - [x] charts: cleanup of code, mayhaps add some testing
    - [x] charts: is the current memoization correct?
    - [x] charts: test with very few drops
    - [x] add window selection buttons to drilldown card
    - [x] when range is selected, single click should remove it
    - [x] tune in swr caching/reloading behavior
    - [x] improve crash sorting
        - change logic of backend to sort by count by default
        - then on the frontend if it's `crashesSortByReason`, then array.slice.sort(...)
        - copy the sort code from [](/core/components/StatsManager/statsUtils.ts#L87)
    - [x] adapt code to track resource drops + adjust categories according to the new ones
        - [x] server shutting down should not be counted
        - [x] add migration for `user-initiated`, `server-initiated` and `resources[]`

        - [x] increase the size of the cursor Y value indicator? maybe move to where the mouse is instead of x=0
        - [x] increase `h-[26rem]` back to 28 after removing the new chart warning
        - [x] swr disable revalidateOnFocus and use interval
            - or some kind of push from the dashboard room event
        - [?] buttons to show memory usage, maybe hide player count
        - [?] calculate initial zoom of 30h
            - Initial zoom code: https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-area-chart?intent=fork
        - [?] use semi-transparent arrows on the sides to indicate there is more to pan to when hovering
        - [?] show server close reason
        - [?] don't clear svg on render, use d3 joins
    - StatsManager.svRuntime:
        - [?] write log optimizer and remove the webroute 30h filter
            - [ref](/core/components/StatsManager/svRuntime/config.ts#L33)

    - thread perf chart:
        - [?] add the good/bad markers?
        - [?] fix getMinTickIntervalMarker behavior when 0.2
            - maybe just check if it's the hardcoded or color everything blue
            - [ref](/core/components/WebServer/wsRooms/dashboard.ts#L26)
        - [?] color should change correctly at the min interval marker point
        - [?] change the bg color to the color of the average ticket with heavy transparency?

## Small feat
- [x] make server v8 heap reports faster to large changes
- [x] messages to improve:
    - [x] kick
        - [edit](/core/webroutes/player/actions.ts#L342)
    - [x] kick_all
        - [edit](/core/webroutes/fxserver/commands.ts#L105)
    - [x] server stop/restart 
        - change to `admin request`
- [x] separate "announcements" and "dm" permissions
- [x] add "this player is banned until: xxx" to the player modal
- [x] add timestamp to live console
    - [x] track channel of last console output, and if it's different prefix a `\n`
    - [x] modify the live console code
- [x] feat(menu): added keybinds for almost all main page actions
    - check if the RegisterCommand is colocated
    - need to add and test `if not menuIsAccessible then return end` to all keybinds

## Fixes
- [x] logout now brings to the login page with post-login redirect
- [x] fix new dashboard not redirecting to set up
- [x] the WarningBar scrolls up with the pages when they have scroll
- [x] fix the message `Since this is not a critical file, ...` on first boot without txData
    - from `SvRuntimeStatsManager` and `PlayerDropStatsManager` + persistent cache
- [x] fix: doing /tx <disconnected id> shows empty modal
- [x] fix the spam of `[tx:WebServer:AuthMws] Invalid session auth: admin_not_found`
- [x] fix: `server partial hang detected` should not be the error for `(HB:0HC:--)`
- [x] fix txDiagnostics (and add tx v8 heap data to it)

## Chores + refactor + boring stuff
- [x] remove /legacy/dashboard route + handler
- [x] remove more pending DynamicNewBadge/DynamicNewItem (settings page as well)
    - and add new ones to the player drops and settings
- [x] improve the procps/wmic error messages
- [x] check if the client print issues have been solved
    - https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/commit/cafd87148a9a47eb267c24c00ec15f96103d4257
    - https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/commit/84f724ed04d07e0b3a765601ad19ce54412f135b
- [x] check if chat PRs were merged, and start migrating recipes to use `resources_useSystemChat`
- [x] merge easy PRs
- [x] check the noLookAlikesAlphabet vs nanoid-dictionary/nolookalikes situation
    - the nanoid version is 49 chars long, and yet it's referenced as dict51
- [x] healthmonitor: write to logger.fxserver the internal reason as marker
- [x] check compatibility with `sv_enableNetEventReassembly false`
- [x] update packages
- [x] update wouter and add search/filters state to URL of the players/history pages
- [x] drop category tooltips on drops page
- [x] feat(panel): add player/action modal ref to url search param
- [x] buffer fxserver lrstream for 5 seconds before stripping colors
- [x] fix(core): a `EMFILE: too many open files` error on windows will cause the `admins.json` to reset
    - [ref](/core/components/AdminVault/index.js#L289)
- [!] check cicd stuff on testing repo before release
- [?] add `.yarn.installed` to the dist? even in dev
- [?] check netid uint16 overflow
    - right now the `mutex#netid` is being calculated on [logger](/core/components/Logger/handlers/server.js#L148)
    - detect netid rollover and set some flag to add some identifiable prefix to the mutex?
    - increase mutex to 6 digits?
    - `/^(?<mutex>\w{5})#(?<netid>\d{1,6})(?:r(?<rollover>\d{1,3}))?$/`
    - write parser, which will return the groups, defaulting rollover to 0
- [?] check if it makes sense to allow the txAdmin thread to run more than every 50ms
    - node 22 branch -> code/components/citizen-server-monitor/src/MonitorInstance.cpp:307
- [?] implement `.env`
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-expand
    - https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=repo%3Avercel%2Fnext.js+%40next%2Fenv
    - https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next-env/index.ts
    - Use with chokidar on `main-builder.js` to restart the build
    - Pass it through so I could use it for the server as well
    - Don't forget to update `development.md`
    - node 22 `process.loadEnvFile(path)`?
- [?] check tx on node 22
- [?] see if it's a good idea to replace `getHostStats.js` with si.osInfo()
    - same for getting process load, instead of fixing the wmic issue


## Tentative Database Changes
- [ ] migration to change "revocation" to optional
    - [ ] test the `getRegisteredActions()` filter as object, doing `{revocation: undefined}`
- [ ] add player name history
- [ ] add player session time tracking
    - [ref](/core/playerLogic/playerClasses.ts#L281)
    - [ ] create simple page to list top 100 players by playtime in the last 30d, 14d, 7d, yesterday, today
    - if storing in a linear UInt16Array, 100k players * 120d * 4bytes per date = 48mb

## live console persistent clear:
- either use the timestamps from above, or
- create mutex to the FXServerLogger, so client knows when it's reset
- when sending initial data, send also the number of bytes that have been wiped
- upon "clear", panel saves to session storage the mutex, the bytes from item above + bytes received
- use the data above to wipe data udner the offset when joining the session


This worked, no time to check which. 
Note it's in the core root and not in the `types` folder, also it has an `export` before the declaration.
```js
//file: core/global.d.ts
export declare global {
    const globals: any;
    namespace globalThis {
        interface Console {
            xxxx: any
        }
    }
    namespace NodeJS {
        interface Global {
            xxxx: any
        }
    }
    interface Console {
        exampleProperty: string;
    }
}

// pra garantir que nada no primeiro tick use global tx instance, antes de instanciar a classe txAdmin,
// fazer global.xxxxx ser uma classe com um getter pras vars do txAdmin, mas throw new error
class ErrorOnAccess {
    constructor() { }
    get xxxxxx(): any {
        throw new Error(`initial tick`);
    }
}
```

Refactor:
- core/components -> core/modules
- core/webroutes -> core/routes
- core/types/global.d.ts -> core/global.d.ts
- UpdateChecker -> CfxUpdateChecker
- remove core/playerLogic & core/extra
- core/utils:
    - fxsVersionParser.ts
    - getOsDistro.js
    - got.js
    - helpers.ts (split)
    - isIpAddressLocal.ts
    - MemCache.ts
    - pidUsageTree.js
    - testEnv.ts
    - xss.js
- core/logic
    - banner.js

    - fxsConfigHelper.ts
    - playerClasses.ts
    - playerFinder.ts
    - playerResolver.ts
    - recipeEngine.js
    - serverDataScanner.ts
    - setupProfile.js
- webroutes/diagnostics/diagnosticsFuncs -> core/utils/diagnostics.ts
- panel/src/lib/utils.ts - split all time humanization into a separate file





==================================================

# svNetwork (should be 100fps)
29037t / 300s = 96.79fps
300s / 29037t = 10.33ms

# svSync (should be 120fps)
35893t / 300s = 119.64fps
300s / 35893t = 8.36ms

# svMain (should be 20fps)
5965t / 300s = 19.88fps
300s / 5965t = 50.29ms


==================================================

## Next up... ish
- Kick as punishment might be needed since minimum ban is 1 hour, possible solutions:
    - Allow for ban minutes
    - Add a "timeout" button that brings a prompt with 1/5/15/30 mins buttons
    - Add a checkbox to the kick modal to mark it as a punishment

- Highlights:
    - [ ] add average session time tracking to statsManager.playerDrop

- Small feats, fix, and improvements:
    - [ ] persistent live console clearing + scroll back in time
    - [ ] locale file optimization - build 8201 and above
    - [ ] easter egg???
        - some old music? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNoaXej0Jeg
        - Having the menu protest when someone fixes their car too much in a short time span?
        - Zeus or crazy thunder effects when someone spams no clip?
        - Increasingly exciting 'tada' sounds when someone bans multiple people in a short time span? (ban 1: Ooh.. / ban 2: OOooh.. / ban 3: OOOOOHHH!)
    - [ ] use `ScanResourceRoot()`

- Chores + Refactor stuff:
    - [ ] remove more pending DynamicNewBadge/DynamicNewItem (settings page as well)
    - [ ] reevaluate globals?.tmpSetHbDataTracking
    - [ ] fix socket.io multiple connections - start a single instance when page opens, commands to switch rooms
    - [ ] evaluate and maybe add event bus
    - [ ] switch tx to lua54

- Boring stuff:
    - [ ] fix the eslint config + tailwind sort
        - [alternative](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-sorted-classes/)
        - search the notes below for "dprint" and "prettier"
    - [ ] build: generate fxmanifest files list dynamically
        - node 22 use fs.glob
    - [ ] fix remaining imgur links
    - [ ] update docs on development?
    - [ ] rename to de-capitalize components files that have multiple exports 
    - [ ] instead of showing cfg errors when trying to start server, just show "there are errors in your cfg file" and link the user to the cfg editor page
    - [ ] break down the discord /info command in /info and /admininfo?
    - [ ] enable nui strict mode
        - check if the menu -> tx -> iframe -> legacy iframe is not working
        - check both canary and prod builds


=======================================================================


# React Migration Roadmap
- [ ] Setup
- [ ] Deployer

- [x] Players
- [x] History
- [ ] Whitelist
- [ ] Admins
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Master Actions
- [ ] Diagnostics (TODO:)
- [x] System Logs (TODO:)

- [x] Dashboard
- [x] Live Console
- [ ] Resources
    - by default show just the "newly added" resources?
- [ ] Server Log
- [ ] CFG Editor
- [ ] Advanced (TODO:)


## Next Page Changes:
### CFG Editor:
- multiple cfg editors
- add backup file to txdata, with the last 100 changes, name of the admin and timestamp

### Setup:
- don't ask for server data location, list txData subfolders and let the user pick or specify
- don't ask for cfg location, assume server.cfg and let the user change

### Master Actions:
- reset fxserver - becomes server add/remove/edit, or just an option in settings -> fxserver
- clean database - "bulk changes" button at the players page
- revoke whitelists - button to whitelist pages

### Admin manager:
- stats on admins
    - total count of bans/warns
    - counts of bans/warns in the last 7, 14, 28d
    - revocation %
    - bans/warns %

### Resources:
- v1:
    - should be stateful, with websocket
    - layout inspired in code editors
    - left sidebar with resource folders, no resources, with buttons to start/stop/restart/etc
    - search bar at the top, searches any folder, has filters
    - filters by default, running, stopped
    - main content will show the resources of the selected folder OR "recently added"
- v2:
    - show "recently added" resources
    - each resoruce need to have:
        - warning for outdated, button to update
        - performance stats
        - option to add/remove from auto boot
        - option to auto restart on change (dev mode)
        - button to see related insights (http calls, events, etc?)

### Whitelist:
- remove the wl pending join table
- add a "latest whitelists" showing both pending and members (query players + pending and join tables)
- don't forget to keep the "add approval" button
- bulk actions button
    - bulk revoke whitelist

### Action Modal:
- feat requests:
    - be able to delete bans/warns with new permission (Issue #910)
    - top server asked for the option to edit ban duration (expire now / change)
    - Thought: need to add an edit log like the one we have for player notes
    - Thought: maybe we could use some dedicated icons for Expired, Edited, Revoked



=======================================================================

# TODO: v7.3+
- [ ] NEW PAGE: Whitelist
- [ ] `2xl:mx-8` for all pages? (change on MainShell)
- [ ] console nav button to jump to server start or errors? 
    - Or maybe filter just error lines (with margin)
    - Or maybe even detect all channels and allow you to filter them, show dropdown sorted by frequency
- [ ] cfg parser: resource relative read errors shouldn't trigger warnings
- [ ] check again for the need of lazy loading
- [ ] put in server name in the login page, to help lost admins notice they are in the wrong txAdmin
- [ ] update stuff that requires WMIC to use PS command directly 
    - NOTE: perhaps just use `systeminformation.processLoad()` instead
    - issue: https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/issues/970#issuecomment-2308462733
    - new lib, same dev: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pidusage-gwmi
    - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/07-working-with-wmi?view=powershell-7.2


# Easy way of doing on/off duty scripts:
- the current ones out there exist by abusing the auth event:
    - `TriggerEvent("txcl:setAdmin", false, false, "you are offduty")`
- provide an export to register a resource as a onduty validator
- when an auth sets place, reach out to the registered export to validate if someone should get the admin perms or not
    - if not, return an error message displaying a `[resource] <custom message>` as the fail reason
- provide an export to trigger the admin auth of any player
- provide an export to trigger a setAdmin removing the perms

=======================================================================

```js
import bytes from 'bytes';
import fs from 'node:fs';
const srcDb = 'E:\\FiveM\\txData\\default\\data\\playersDB.json';
const destFile = 'E:\\TMP\\deletar-referencias-tx\\playersDB.json'
const currRss = () => bytes(process.memoryUsage().rss);
import stream from 'stream';

import Chain from 'stream-chain';
import Disassembler from 'stream-json/Disassembler.js';
import Stringer from 'stream-json/Stringer.js';

export const saveToFileStreaming = (hugeArrayOfObjects: any) => {
    new Chain([
        stream.Readable.from(hugeArrayOfObjects, { objectMode: true }),
        new Disassembler(),
        new Stringer(),
        fs.createWriteStream(destFile)
    ])
}

setInterval(() => {
    console.log('.');
}, 100);

console.log('RSS before read:', currRss());
const dbo = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(srcDb, 'utf8'));
console.log('RSS after read:', currRss());
console.log('DB Players:', dbo.players.length);

console.log('Awaiting 30s...');
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('RSS before write:', currRss());
    console.time('stringify+write');
    const dboString = JSON.stringify([dbo]);
    fs.writeFileSync(destFile, dboString);
    // saveToFileStreaming([dbo]);
    console.timeEnd('stringify+write');
    console.log('RSS after write:', currRss());
}, 30*1000);

//normal 202 -> 714mb, em 450ms
//lib 202 -> weird 1gb peak
```

=======================================================================

## Next Up
- After Node 22:
    - change the gh workflows to use node 22 as well
    - check all `.npm-upgrade.json` for packages that can now be updated
    - Use `/^\p{RGI_Emoji}$/v` to detect emojis 
        - ref: https://v8.dev/features/regexp-v-flag
        - remove `unicode-emoji-json` from dependencies
        - update cleanPlayerNames
    - it will support native bindings, so this might work:
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/fd-lock

- [ ] Playerlist: implement basic tag system with filters, sorting and Fuse.js
    - the filter dropdown is written already, check `panel/src/layout/playerlistSidebar/Playerlist.tsx`
    - when filterString is present, disable the filter/sort drowdown, as it will show all results sorted by fuse.js
    - might be worth to debounce the search
    - add tags to the players page search box (separate dropdown?)
    - maybe https://shadcnui-expansions.typeart.cc/docs/multiple-selector

- [ ] create new "Remove Player Data" permission which would allow to delete bans/warns, players and player identifiers
    - Ref: https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/issues/751

- [ ] maybe use [this lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ntp-time-sync) to check for clock skew so I can remove the complexity of dealing with possible desync between core and ui on player modal, scheduler, etc;
    - even better: clients2.google.com/time/1/current

- [ ] write some automated tests for the auth logic and middlewares
    - https://youtu.be/bzXtYVH4WOg

- [ ] slide gesture to open/close the sidebars on mobile
- [ ] new restart schedule in status card
- [ ] ask framework owners to use `txAdmin-locale`
- [ ] xxxxxx


### Linter notes
- maybe biome?
- Maybe prettier for all files except ts/js which could be in dprint
- Use the tailwind sorter plugin
- When running prettier, add ignore to the imported external files
https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html
https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier


### Improved scheduler precision
Talvez mudar a abordagem pra ser uma array e toda vez que a dist√¢ncia at√© o primeiro item for zero, executar a a√ß√£o e dar um shift nos valores?
Exemplo:
```js
[
    {time: "12:00", temp: false, skipped: false},
    {time: "18:00", temp: false, skipped: false},
    {time: "22:00", temp: false, skipped: false},
]
```
Se a dist√¢ncia pro [0] for <= 0, executar restart e jogar o 12:00 pro final da array

```js
function scheduleNextExecution() {
  const now = new Date();
  const delay = 60 * 1000 - (now.getSeconds() * 1000 + now.getMilliseconds()) + 1000;

  setTimeout(() => {
    yourFunction(); // replace this with your function
    scheduleNextExecution();
  }, delay);

### Tutorial discord bot:
- Make tutorial with excalidraw?!
- sometimes discord just bugs out, maybe kick the bot and invite him again
- also ctrl+r to reload discord
- tell them not to fuck up the placeholder
- tell them the http/https limitation




### Server resource scanner
ScanResourceRoot('E:/FiveM/txData/default.base/resources/', (data: object) => {
    console.dir(data, { depth: 5 });
});

teste:
    remover meu admin do sv zap
    dar join
    apertar f1 e ver se aparece a mensagem de perms

# TODO: sooner than later
- [ ] maybe add some debug logging to `AdminVault.checkAdminsFile()`, to find out why so many people are having issues with their logins
    - maybe even add to the login failed page something like "admin file was reset or modified XXX time ago"
- [ ] server logger add events/min average
- [ ] no duplicated id type in bans? preparing for the new db migration
- [ ] `cfg cyclical 'exec' command detected to file` should be blocking instead of warning. Beware that this is not trivial without also turning missing exec target read error also being error





=======================================================================

> Maybe do this on the ban message page template
```css
background-image: url("https://i.imgur.com/5bFhvBv.png");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: right 15px bottom 15px;
```

```js
//Resource didn't finish starting (if res boot still active)
`resource "${starting.startingResName}" failed to start within the [120~600]s time limit`

//Resources started, but no heartbeat within limit after that
`server failed to start within time limit - 45s after last resource started`

//No resource started starting, hb over limit
`server failed to start within time limit - ${this.hardConfigs.heartBeat.failLimit}s, no onResourceStarting received`

//Server started, but some time after it stopped replying http requests

=======================================================================

## New config
- july 2023: consider that some vars will be used in more than one component, so making them live in one or another might not be good
- the modules should be the ones to decide when they need to refreshConfig, so inside the module constructor maybe subscribe to change of specific variables, (in or outside of module). Maybe use event dispatchers?!

- early 2023: acho que os defaults deveriam existir dentro dos components
e sempre que outro componente precisar saber uma config, deve passar pelo componente
- need to have a version and have migration, like the database

- do research, but i think we don't need any lib
- break up cfg files into `txData/<profile>/global.txcfg` and `txData/<profile>/server.txcfg`
- cfg file format is
    - trim every line
    - ignore empty lines or lines starting with // or # (may help people testing stuff, depends on file ext?)
    - `param_name=<json object>` (usually strings, but we could encode more complex data types if needed)
    - ignore with warning lines with invalid json objects
- parameters format suggestion: `playercontroller_onJoinCheckWhitelist` (?)
- REQUIRING stuff to ve on the config from the setup process is kinda bad (setupProfile.js), but might be good to check if the file is in there
- at boot, for every default config:
    - check if the cfg file overwrites it
    - check if an environment env overwrites it (case insensitive) then print warning (maybe not all vars, due to unauthorized GSPs)
- warn of any settings in the file that is not being used
- cfg vault has the defaults in the Zod format (for type safety) or simply
```js
const defaults = {
    playercontroller_onjoincheckwhitelist: {
        default: false,
        "accepted types or values??": "??"
    };
}
```
- maybe get rid of txAdmin.ts passing down specific cfgs, and pass txAdmin instance instead
- the modules can go `this.config.onJoinCheckWhitelist = txAdmin.cfgVault.configs.playercontroller_onJoinCheckWhitelist`
- careful because some will passs by value, some may pass as object reference therefore be live updated inside the module
- modules can do `txAdmin.cfgVault.subscribe(this.refreshConfig.bind(this), [...deps])`
- settings_get page reads from `txAdmin.cfgVault.configs`, so if a value was overwritten by proc.env, it will not cause confusion
- settings_save does `txAdmin.cfgVault.save([...])`
- use zod for validation https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod
- maybe even use zod's `.default()`?
- maybe components don't even need to hold a `this.config`? couldn't we just access it directly from the vault?
- need to keep in mind that many configs are used in the webroutes, so maybe just `txAdmin.config.xxx` and `ServerInstance.config.xxx`?
- 'convict' was the name of that one lib


### old settings refactor note:
- save only what changed
- make big settings a class (like TFR)
- settings.getConfig(); - returns the full config tree with unset props as null
- settings.get('object.dot.notation');
- settings.set('object.dot.notation');
- npm search for "object dot"

Somewhen:
- [ ] checar se outros resources conseguem chamar 'txaLogger:menuEvent'?
- [ ] Migrate all log routes
- [ ] Add download modal to log pages
- [ ] replace all fxRunner.srvCmd* and only expose:
    - sync fxRunner.srvRawCmd(string) - to be used by live console
    - async fxRunner.srvCmd(array, timeout) - to be awaited with the status response
- [ ] add an fxserver changelog page
- [ ] check EOL and warn user - new Date('2021-09-14T07:38:51+00:00').getTime()
- [ ] maybe remove the sv_maxclients enforcement in the cfg file
- [ ] fix the interface enforcement without port being set as zap server?


### Randoms:
-- Why both have the same debug data? https://i.imgur.com/WGawiyr.png

FIXME: sendMenuMessage('setServerCtx', ServerCtx)

FIXME: quando o menu abrir, deveria voltar os list item pro default deles

-- Adapt `txAdmin:beta:deathLog` as well as add cusstom commands and logs

- pagina de adicionar admin precisa depois do modal, mostrar mais info:
    - username, senha, potencialmente link, instru√ß√µes de login
- FreezeEntityPosition need to get the veh
    - j√° foi feito? tem issue aberto, e j√° teve um pr feito
- come√ßar a ler o ui_label dos manifests e usar na p√°gina de resources
    - ser√° que o bubble j√° adicionou isso no fxserver? n√£o faz parte das docs ainda (oct/2022)


### Server Insights page ideas:
- resource load times
- resource streamed assets
- biggest events, or resources kbps out? something to help see which resource is bottlenecking the network
    - apparently this can be done in scheduler quite easily by modifying the definition of `TriggerClientEvent`
- http requests (grouped by resource, grouped by root domain or both?)
- performance chart with ram usage
- player count (longer window, maybe with some other data)
    - show the player count at the peaks
- histogram of session time
- chart of new players per day
- top players? 
- map heatmap?!
- player disconnect reasons
- something with server log events like chat messages, kills, leave reasons, etc?
- we must find a way to show player turnover and retention, like % that come back, etc

https://www.npmjs.com/package/tldts

### txAdminAPI interface in base.js:
- Create prop `pendingMessage` to replace `const notify = $.notify({ message: 'xxxxxx' }, {});`
- Pass `notify` as last argument to `success()` and `error()`
- Create default `success()` and `error()`
    - for `success()`: first exec `checkDoLogoutRefresh()`
    - if `pendingMessage` was set: 
        - if data.markdown === true > usar markdown
    - else: send new notify

someday remove the slash() and the ascii restrictions



### Multiserver refactor:
Global:
- WebServer
- AdminVault
- ConfigVault
- DiscordBot
- Logger
- Translator
- DynamicAds
- UpdateChecker > CfxUpdateChecker

Instance[]:
- FXRunner
- Monitor > HealthMonitor
- Scheduler
- PlayerController > PlaylistManager
- ResourcesManager
- StatisticsManager

Questions:
- How to make the database interface (currently in playerController)
- Should break logger and config in 2 or work top->down?

march/2023 insight:
- if no `txData/config`
- move the profile config and data to txdata
- rename `txData/<profile>` to `txData/<profile>_bkp`
- at run time:
    - check if `txData/lock` exists
    - if it doesn't
        - save pid + interface + port to lock file
    - if it does
        - see if the pid is running
        - say "you cant run two tx on the same txdata, open <url> to visit the other one"


### Adaptive cards system
- Does not require the new ace system or the API
- Resources can register their adaptive cards interface which will show in the tx nui main tab, or as a player card tab
- The resources add a `ui_cards` definition to their `fxmanifest.lua` which is scanned by txadmin
- When an admin clicks on the button added, it will send a event through stdin to the tx resource which will verify caller and then call the resource export with the required context (eg. player id, admin name, etc). The exported function returns an adaptive card which is sent to txAdmin through fd3.
- This allows for resources to add their own UI to txAdmin, which supports buttons, inputs, etc
- cfx reference: `ext/cfx-ui/src/cfx/apps/mpMenu/parts/LegacyConnectingModal/AdaptiveCardPresenter/AdaptiveCardPresenter.tsx`

```lua
ui_cards 'list' {
    ['playerInfo'] = {
        title = 'RP Info',
        type = 'player', --show in player card
    },
    ['generalStatsNui'] = {
        title = 'RP Stats',
        type = 'mainmenu', --show in nui main menu
    },
    ['generalStatsWeb'] = {
        title = 'RP Stats',
        type = 'web', --show in the web panel
    },
}
```


### Update Event + Rollout strategy
This is not compatible with the update events.
If patch, show update notification immediately (especially important to quick-fix a bug).
If minor, randomize a delay between 0~24h.
If patch, randomize a delay 0~72h.

### New database alternatives:
> check the chat saved messages on that chat
- Via lowdb + journal:
    - Keep players saved the way it is (lowdb, one server only)
    - create `txData/actions.json` which is an append-only, line delimited json
    - multiple servers write to this file, use debounced chokidar to read it starting from last offset to reload in-memory state;
- Via sqlite:
    - first txadmin to run will instantiate a `txData/actions.sqlite` database (becoming master)
    - will provide an http endpoint for the slaves to query data
    - leader election can be done via the first to acquire a lock on a file
- Via external server process
    - If server is not running, a standalone server like cockroachdb or rqlite
    - 

Ideas:
- Maybe we could use b-trees to index identifiers/hwids somewhere?
- Maybe we break the separation between players and identifiers, and bans/warns always try to find the respective player
- Maybe we could go full `mongod.exe`
    - very mature, great docs
    - 45mb file, 120mb process
    - to search for ids we can do `{identifiers: {$in: ['discord:xxxxx', 'fivem:yyyyy']}}`

### txAdmin API/integrations:
- ban/warn/whitelist + revoke action: probably exports with GetInvokingResource() for perms 
- get player info (history, playtime, joindate, etc): state bags
- events: keep the way it is
> Note: confirm with bubble
> Don't forget to add a integrations doc page + to the readme
> for menu and internal stuff to use token-based rest api: ok, just make sure to use the webpipe proxy
> for resource permissions, use resource.* ace thing, which also works for exports

ps.: need to also include the external events reporting thing


### Admin ACE sync:
NOTE: Dec/2023 - why even bother?! Current system works, and we can exports the player permissions via state bags or whatever

On server start, or admins permission change:
- write a `txData/<profile>/txAcePerms.cfg` with:
    - remove_ace/remove_principal to wipe old permissions (would need something like `remove_ace identifier.xxx:xx txadmin.* any`)
    - or just `remove_ace identifier.xxx:xx txadmin.*` which would remove all aces, for all subscopes
    - add_ace/add_principal for each admin
- stdin> `exec xxx.cfg; txaBroadcast xxxxx`

- We should be able to get rid of our menu state management, mainly the part that sends to lua what are the admin ids when something changes
To check of admin perm, just do `IsPlayerAceAllowed(src, 'txadmin.xxxxxx')`
> Don't use, but I'll leave it saved here: https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/commit/fd3fae946163e8af472b7f739aed6f29eae8105f
- need to find a way to protect against scripts, cfg/console changing these aces
- would be cool to have a `SetProtectedMonitorAces(table)` native dedicated to txadmin to set every admin/resource ace perms


### txPointing (old txBanana)
- code prototype with ItsANoBrainer#1337 (https://github.com/tabarra/txBanana)
- keybind to toggle gun (grab or put away)
- when you point at player, show above head some info
- when you "shoot" it will open the player menu and hopefully fire a laser or something
- when you right click, slap player (ApplyDamageToPed 5 damage + small psysichs push up and x+y random)


### recipe engine todo:
- remove_path accept array?
- every X download_github wait some time - maybe check if ref or not, to be smarter
- https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git
- easy recipe tester
- fully automated deploy process via CLI. You just set the recipe file path, as well as the required variables, and you can get your server running without any user interaction.


### Report System (random ideas)
- persistent, save in database?
- have two different status: visited (arr of admins), closed (admin that closed)
- this one is worth having discordwebhook


=======================================

## FXServer Stuff + TODOs

### Rate limiter
We could be more sensible when restarting the server and pushing an event to alert other resources that might want to auto block it.
```bat
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="txAdmin_block_XXXX" dir=in interface=any action=block remoteip=198.51.100.108/32
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="txAdmin_block_XXXX"
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="txAdmin_block_XXXX"
```
https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/search?q=KeyedRateLimiter


### Oversized resources streams
We could wait for the server to finish loading, as well as print in the interface somewhere an descending ordered list of large resource assets
https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/blob/649dac8e9c9702cc3e293f8b6a48105a9378b3f5/code/components/citizen-server-impl/src/ResourceStreamComponent.cpp#L435


### Spectating with routing bucket:
Message from bubble:
> the obvious 'approach' works well enough:
> - get target routing bucket on server
> - save old source
> - teleport source player to in scope
> - send event to source client
> ------- client -------
> - set focus pos and vel, less shit than 'xd teleport' and should trip server to cull anyway
> - make self invisible/such
> - wait for target player to exist
> - use spectate native
> and when stopping spectating do the opposite of that
